Community Meetup App with Customizable SDK

This repository contains the codebase for a community meetup app that allows users to organize and participate in various meetups and events. The app provides a rich set of features for managing events, RSVPs, notifications, and more.

In addition to the main app, this repository also includes a customizable SDK that empowers developers to create their own branded versions of the meetup app. The SDK allows event organizers or communities to customize the look, feel, and functionality of their meetup pages within the app.

Key Features:
- Event creation and management: Create and manage meetups, set event details, and specify attendance limits.
- RSVP and attendance tracking: Users can RSVP to events and track their attendance status.
- Notifications and reminders: Get timely notifications and reminders for upcoming events.
- Customizable meetup pages: The included SDK enables event organizers to customize their meetup pages, including branding, layout, and additional features.
- User profiles and networking: Users can create profiles, connect with other attendees, and expand their professional networks.
- Search and discovery: Discover new meetups based on interests, location, and date.

By providing this customizable SDK, we aim to empower communities, organizations, or businesses to leverage the meetup app infrastructure while maintaining their unique identity and catering to their specific needs.
